This project was designed and implemented in my Software Engineering class with my partners Kent and Adrian. This is an implementation of a VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) receiver which was a primary navigation system for pilots before the introduction of the GPS. Import project to Eclipse IDE and in the ics314_VOR_abut folder run finalVORGUI.java
